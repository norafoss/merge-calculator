# Merge Calculator
This is just a fun pet project for myself, as I am a big fan of the iPhone game MergeDragons.

I will be using Python to create a calculator to find how many lower level items are needed to merge up to a higher level one.

Initially I plan to make this only handle 5-merging (as this is more efficient for gameplay) but hope to then add a 3-merging option for comparison.
